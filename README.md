Some info about the useful files in my branch: 

Background_chop:
- ignores data values at the ends of the real data files are these are effectively negligible and just noise
- Because no. of data points for MC and real data are not the same, reduced size of real data set by taking averages ( see code for details)
- Need to add functionality to allow making specific cuts
- Needs cross-verification 

chop_v1:
- Made a minor bug fix but other than that this is identical to the one in Dominic's branch
